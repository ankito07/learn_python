##How does Python works?
# Python code that we write goes to python interpreter gets converted from human readable to machine codes i.e. 0's and 1's and then gets executed using a compiler.

#Here we take user's name as input store it in name variable and then print it.
name = input("Hey, What is your Name?")
print("Hey "+name)
